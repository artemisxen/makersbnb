## MakersBnB

A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

The project is built during our week 6 at Makers Academy. We had no prior experience working with chosen technologies. The purpose of the week was to focus on learning a new stack within a short time frame and practice working as a team of 4, religiously following XP values and being Agile.

Here's the public link to the trello board with the [USER STORIES](https://trello.com/b/BXEphDZa/makersbnb).
### Instructions:
```
git clone git@github.com:chuk-chuk/makersbnb.git

### Technologies used:
- Node.js

A server side JavaScript execution environment. It’s a platform built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript runtime. It helps in building highly scalable and concurrent applications rapidly.

- Express

A lightweight framework used to build web applications in Node. It provides a number of robust features for building single and multi page web application.

- PostgreSQL

A powerful, open source object-relational database system.

- Mocha & Chai (assertion library) & Zombie.js

A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. Zombie.js is a lightweight framework for testing client-side JavaScript code in a simulated environment. No browser required.

The project isn't completed due to limited time (4,5 days).
